      "Voice Activity Detection (VAD) detects voice activity, adapts to background ambient or line noise as well as the presence of echo, classifies voice activity as \"early\" versus \"sustained\", and assigns an \"effort level\" to the speaker that is independent of network loss.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Voice Activity Detector discriminates voice activity generated by a caller from background noise (acoustic and line noise) as well as echo and sidetones reflected back to the receive voice path. It also provides an \"effort level\" quantity that indicates the level of effort of the caller. The functional and performance requirements are specified to cover a wide range of applications, such as voice activated recordings (as in voice messaging), outbound call classification, digital speech interpolation (DSI), and voice conferencing.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.       The Voice Activity Detector classifies every block of voice data (8 ms          long) as \"port active\" (early detect), \"speaker active\" (port          sustained), and \"not active\".\n",
      "\n",
      "2.       It provides a measurement that approximates the level of effort exerted          by the caller. Such an approximation is made by normalizing the short          term RMS of the voice signal by a longer term RMS value. The \"effort          level\" varies between -32 dB and 31 dB, and is at 0 dB when the speaker          is speaking at his/her \"normal\" level.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.       The Voice Activity Detector adapts to background noise up to -24 dBm.          Adaptation is 200 ms when the noise level drops, and is approximately          1000 ms when noise rises.\n",

      "The accuracy of the voice Activity detector is measured by the rate of \"false detection\" (i.e. classifying noise or echo as voice activity) and \"clipping\" (i.e. classifying voice activity as noise or echo) under different ambient noise and echo conditions. \"Port active\" detection under different ambient noise conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.       No perceptible clipping at quiet to modest noise levels of -50 dBm to          -40 dBm with nominal levels of speech activity (-20 dBm average power          over 2 seconds of speech). No more than 5% of voice onsets is clipped          for noisy conditions (noise level from -40 dBm to -30 dBm).\n",
