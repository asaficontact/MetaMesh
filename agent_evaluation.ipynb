According to Section 2.3.2 of the contract, while Aimmune may sublicense the rights granted to it under Section 2.1 to its Affiliates or Third Parties (termed as \"Sublicensees\"), Aimmune remains responsible for ensuring that its Sublicensees comply with the provisions of the Agreement. Additionally, the sublicense agreement must include terms that adhere to the restrictions and obligations laid out in the main agreement, particularly regarding reporting, auditing, and confidentiality (Sections 2.2.1 and 2.4).\\n\\nMoreover, Aimmune is not permitted to research or develop the Antibody itself beyond what is explicitly outlined in the definition of a Product per Section 2.2.1, which further restricts its ability to expand or transfer those rights freely.\\n\\nThus, although Aimmune can sublicense its rights, this ability is constrained by the terms set forth in the Agreement, ensuring that any transfer or sublicense does not circumvent the conditions and obligations imposed by the original contract.'},\n",

The specific obligations detail that prior to the First Commercial Sale of a Product, the clinical trials insurance coverage must be no less than a specified monetary amount per loss occurrence, and product liability insurance coverage after such sale must also meet a specified monetary threshold.\\n\\nThis insurance requirement is aimed at ensuring that Aimmune can cover its liabilities arising from the Development, Commercialization, and potential adverse events related to the Product.
